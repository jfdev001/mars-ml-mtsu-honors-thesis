** Git
   git branch <new-branch>              # Create new branch
   git branch --sort=-committerdate     # Lists in commit order
   git branch -m <new-branch-name>      # Renames local branch
   git checkout <branch-name>           # Change to branch-name
   git checkout -b <branch-name>        # Create and checkout branch
   git add <file-path, use ./ for all>  # Stage file
   git commit -m "Message"              # Commit staged files
   git merge <other-branch>             # Merges other-branch w/ cur branch

** Design
   Footnotes:
   -- How to make data_list faster? Possibly use yield?
   -- You are processing ~2 million lines of data but how can you speed
      it up?
   -- Can only have one output variable because linear regression is
      only capable of a single output y = B0 + Sum[Bixi]
